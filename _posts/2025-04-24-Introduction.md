### G'Day Mate
hi, mate. I'm kang. 

### EXPERIENCE
```
Library Developer Research (esp. Computer Vision)  
FourthLogic Inc.  
🗓️ 04/2020 - 08/2024    📍 18 Teheran-ro 20-gil, Gangnam
```

➥  Developed Advanced Computer Vision Systems, esp. Match systems.  
    Overcoming tradeoff between speed and accuracy, make it the world-wide-best high performace in terms of speed and accuracy.  
    this model is more better than halcon product, then i achieved the patent in US.
    For instance, 300x300 learned image, 5000x5000 image needed to find, processing speed is under 5ms, over 99.9% accuracy.  
    The overhead functions are adapted in multi-thread, then the efficient is almost 100%. This means that our computer had 24 threads so  

➥  I know the importance to designed codes with clear and easily maintaining, stable, recycling systems. With this design, I can make more robust and less deficit issues.  

➥  Optimized the naive code, researching the high performance with SIMD. I get accustomed to optimize the various process with SIMD. Not only easiler process, but difficult process hard to adapt.  

➥  Researching the parallel systems. I adapted the parallel systems like Multi-thread to my algorithm. I analysis the code flow and design the parallel calcuation formula, even integral algorithm informed impossible. I have experienced to achieve almost 100% efficiency for matching systems. you bet, I usually achieve for many kind of algorithms the high-level efficiency.  

➥  In AI and rule-based systems in image processing, part of data is one of the importance things to develop systems. With major, I always analysis the perspective, esp. bias, so I usually distinguish the unacceptable and valueable samples.  

➥  When I attend the business or workload, I do work with high attention. I pursuit the hight efficiency for workload. As a result, I consistently met project deadlines and received a commendation for dedication and focus.  

➥  I highly understand the importance of clear code. accumulated clear code makes workload more faster and stable in the wordload. Then easily respond the customer-friendly systems or demanding issues.  

➥  commuication with co-worker by using code is so important. So I always unity of writing code and keep coding convention for efficiency conversation using the code.  

➥  I have smooth communication skill. For junior, try to understand their position or situation and think about how to make the issues more smooth. And For senior, I always try to understand their order and keep their decision. Even though we have difference between perspectives, I start conversations and find the best result with team members.

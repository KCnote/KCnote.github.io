### G'Day Mate
hi, mate. I'm kang. 

### EXPERIENCE
Library Developer Research esp. Computer Vision  
FourthLogic Inc.  
🗓️ 04/2020 - 08/2024    📍 18 Teheran-ro 20-gil, Gangnam

➥  Developed Advanced Computer Vision Systems, esp. Match systems.  
    Overcoming tradeoff between speed and accuracy, make it the world-wide-best high performace in terms of speed and accuracy.  
    this model is more better than halcon, then i achieved the patent in US.
    For instance, 300x300 learned image, 5000x5000 image needed to find, processing speed is under 5ms, over 99.9% accuracy.  

➥  Designed clean, maintainable, stable, api designed, recycling systems  
➥  parallel systems  
➥  Data analysis perspective, bias, 
➥  high attention to business
➥  challenge to cleaning code systems
➥  keep coding convention
➥  smooth communication

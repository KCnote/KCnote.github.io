<code style="color : red">Enough!</code>\
I don’t wanna hear <code style="color : red">another word</code> out of you guys.\
<code style="color : Magenta">Sit down</code>.\
Boy, you really did it this time!\
I just wanna thank you boys for the most <code style="color : red">embarrassing night</code> of my life.\
We are the only family in twelve year to have been <code style="color : Magenta">kicked out</code> of Wacky Jack’s Pizza Pagoda.\
It takes a lot of work to <code style="color : Magenta">get kicked out</code> of a restaurant that has a trampoline and a batting cage. \
But Dad!.\
No, buts.\
That’s it.\
It was Wacky Jack’s <code style="color : blue">fault</code>.\
He was making those stupid faces at us.\
He’s a clown.\
That’s his <code style="color : red">job</code>.\
We didn’t do anything!\
We didn’t do anything!\
Does this look familiar?\
Wacky Jack’s nose – you pulled it right off his face.\
It’s not his real nose.\
I don’t care whose nose it is.\
Don’t pull things off people’s faces.\
And right now, you’re gonna get <code style="color : blue">out of</code> my sight.\
Go up to your rooms,\
March! March!\
Up Up\
If I hear any noise upstair. I’ll be up there.\
And if I have to <code style="color : red">come</code> up there, you won’t want me up there\
C’mom, Mom!\
We didn’t do anything!\
No, quiet now.\
We wanna watch Full House. We didn’t\
No.\
I just want you to know.\
I’m <code style="color : red">innocent</code>\
Innocent\
<code style="color : blue">Pouring</code> salad dressing <code style="color : blue">down</code> your brother’s pants.\
Oh, you saw that.\
Yeah.\
Time, this is <code style="color : red">pathetic</code>\
We’ve sunk to a new low.\
Pizza?\
Yeah, if you <code style="color : blue">take off</code> those mushrooms first.\
Those aren’t mushrooms, honey.\
I’ll pass.\

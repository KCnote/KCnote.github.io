Enough!\
I don’t wanna hear <code style="color : red">another word</code> out of you guys.\
<code style="color : gold">Sit down</code>.\
Boy, you really did it this time!\
I just wanna thank you boys for the most <code style="color : red">embarrassing night</code> of my life.\
We are the only family in twelve year to have been <code style="color : gold">kicked out</code> of Wacky Jack’s Pizza Pagoda.\
It takes a lot of work to <code style="color : gold">get kicked out</code> of a restaurant that has a trampoline and a batting cage. \
But Dad!.\
No, buts.\
That’s it.\
It was Wacky Jack’s <code style="color : Cyan">fault</code>.\
He was making those stupid faces at us.\
He’s a clown.\
That’s his job.\
We didn’t do anything!\
We didn’t do anything!\
Does this look familiar?\
Wacky Jack’s nose – you pulled it right off his face.\
It’s not his real nose.\
I don’t care whose nose it is.\
Don’t pull things off people’s faces.\
And right now, you’re gonna get out of my sight.\
Go up to your rooms,\
March! March!\
Up Up\
If I hear any noise upstair. I’ll be up there.\
And if I have to come up there, you won’t want me up there\
C’mom, Mom!\
We didn’t do anything!\
No, quiet now.\
We wanna watch Full House. We didn’t\
No.\
I just want you to know.\
I’m innocent\
Innocent\
Pouring salad dressing down your brother’s pants.\
Oh, you saw that.\
Yeah.\
Time, this is pathetic\
We’ve sunk to a new low.\
Pizza?\
Yeah, if you take off those mushrooms first.\
Those aren’t mushrooms, honey.\
I’ll pass.\

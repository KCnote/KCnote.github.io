# 💾 RAID — Redundant Array of Independent Disks

> RAID is a technology that **combines multiple physical storage devices** (HDDs or SSDs) into **one logical storage system** to improve **performance**, **reliability**, or **both**.

---

# 1️⃣ What is RAID?

RAID = **Redundant Array of Independent Disks**

It allows multiple drives to act like:
- **One logical disk**
- With improved **speed**, **fault tolerance**, or **data safety**

### Main Goals
✔ Higher performance  
✔ Data redundancy (backup)  
✔ Fault tolerance  
✔ Larger logical storage  

---

# 2️⃣ Key RAID Concepts

## 🔹 Striping
> Splitting data across multiple disks for **higher speed**

```
Disk 1 → A1 A3 A5
Disk 2 → A2 A4 A6
```

✔ Faster read/write  
❌ No redundancy  

---

## 🔹 Mirroring
> Storing **exact copies** of data on multiple disks

```
Disk 1 → DATA
Disk 2 → DATA (Copy)
```

✔ High reliability  
❌ Storage efficiency reduced  

---

## 🔹 Parity
> Extra information used to **detect and recover lost data**

✔ Saves space compared to full copies  
✔ Allows **data recovery** if a disk fails  

---

# 3️⃣ RAID Levels Overview

---

## 🟦 RAID 0 — Striping (Performance)

### How it Works
- Data is **striped across disks**
- No redundancy

### Pros
✔ Very fast I/O  
✔ Full storage utilization  

### Cons
❌ **No fault tolerance**  
❌ One disk failure = data loss  

### Use Case
Gaming PCs, temporary storage, scratch disks

---

## 🟩 RAID 1 — Mirroring (Reliability)

### How it Works
- Data is **fully duplicated**
- Every disk holds a copy

### Pros
✔ High reliability  
✔ Fast reads  

### Cons
❌ Storage capacity = 50%  
❌ Higher cost  

### Use Case
Critical data backups, OS disks

---

## 🟨 RAID 4 — Dedicated Parity Disk

### How it Works
- Data striped across disks  
- **One dedicated disk stores parity**

### Pros
✔ Better capacity efficiency than RAID 1  
✔ Can recover from one disk failure  

### Cons
❌ **Parity disk bottleneck** on writes  

---

## 🟧 RAID 5 — Distributed Parity (Single Parity)

### How it Works
- Data striped across disks  
- **Parity distributed across all disks**

### Pros
✔ No single parity bottleneck  
✔ Survives **1 disk failure**  
✔ Good balance of speed & safety  

### Cons
❌ Write performance overhead  
❌ Rebuild time can be long  

### Common Use
File servers, NAS, enterprise storage

---

## 🟥 RAID 6 — Distributed Dual Parity

### How it Works
- Like RAID 5, but stores **two parity blocks**
- Survives **2 disk failures**

### Pros
✔ Higher fault tolerance than RAID 5  
✔ Safer for large arrays  

### Cons
❌ Slower writes than RAID 5  
❌ More storage overhead  

### Common Use
Enterprise storage, large-scale servers

# 4️⃣ RAID Level Comparison

| RAID | Min Disks | Performance | Redundancy | Usable Capacity |
|------|----------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| RAID 0 | 2 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ❌ None | 100% |
| RAID 1 | 2 | ⭐⭐ | ✅ High | 50% |
| RAID 4 | 3 | ⭐⭐ | ✅ 1 disk | (N-1)/N |
| RAID 5 | 3 | ⭐⭐⭐ | ✅ 1 disk | (N-1)/N |
| RAID 6 | 4 | ⭐⭐ | ✅ 2 disks | (N-2)/N |

---

# 5️⃣ Performance vs Reliability Tradeoff

| RAID Level | Best For |
|-----------|---------|
| RAID 0 | Maximum speed |
| RAID 1 | Maximum safety |
| RAID 5 | Balanced performance & safety |
| RAID 6 | High safety for large arrays |

---

# 6️⃣ RAID Is NOT a Backup

> RAID protects against **disk failure**,  
> but NOT against:  
 ❌ Accidental deletion  
 ❌ Malware / ransomware     
 ❌ File corruption     
 ❌ Fire / theft  

📌 Always use **separate backups**

---

# 7️⃣ Developer Takeaways

✔ RAID 0 = fast but unsafe  
✔ RAID 1 = safe but storage inefficient  
✔ RAID 5 = most common balanced option  
✔ RAID 6 = safer for large storage pools  
✔ RAID improves availability, not data correctness  

---

# 🧩 One-Line Mental Model

> **RAID spreads data across disks to gain speed, safety, or both.**
